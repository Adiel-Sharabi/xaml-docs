# Localization

The built-in localization mechanism in Silverlight and WPF allows you to localize any string resource used by the standard __RadWindow__ control. Once translated you might use your resources in both Silverlight and WPF projects without changing anything.

>tip __To learn more about the ways in which to localize the RadControls please read the common topic about__ [Localization]({%slug common-localization%})__.__

## Supported Languages

__RadWindow__ can be translated in one of the following supported languages using the frameworkâ€™s localization mechanism:

* English
* German
* Spanish
* French
* Italian
* Dutch
* Turkish

## Resource Keys

__RadWindow__ is a user interface control and its strings for localization are numerous. In order to be able to distinguish these resources, an unique identifier, called __resource key__, is assigned to each localizable string.

Here is a list of all of the __Resources__ available and their default values:

|Key|Value|
|---|-----|
|Close|Close|
|Maximize|Maximize|
|Restore|Restore|
|Minimize|Minimize|
