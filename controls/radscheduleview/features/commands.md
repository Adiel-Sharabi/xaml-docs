## CreateAppointment / CreateAppointmentWithDialog Commands

When you want to create a new appointment and show the EditAppointmentDialog, then you need to use the __CreateAppointment__ or __CreateAppointmentWithDialog__ commands. If no parameter is passed, the __SelectedSlot__ of __RadScheduleView__ will be used for the new appointment start and end dates. If you want to explicitly specify which will be the start and end date you should pass a parameter of type __IDateSpan__ (for example Slot is an __IDateSpan__).

The difference between both commands is when neither the parameter nor the __SelectedSlot__ is set. In this case only the __CreateAppointmentWithDialog__ command will show EditAppointmentDialog for the first visible slot, while __CreateAppointment__ command won’t be executed.

#### __C#__

## CreateInlineAppointment Command

Use it when you want to create a new appointment via the inline editing. If no parameter is passed, the __SelectedSlot__ of __RadScheduleView__ will be used for the new appointment start and end dates.
