# Overview

![](images/radsplashscreen-overview-0.png)

RadSplashScreen allows you to display a Telerik themed control that notifies the user that the program is loading. You can customize the image of the splash screen, its animations and loading process visualization.

## Key Features

* __Customizable image content__: The control allows you to easily set the splash screen image.

* __Built-in progress bar__: By default the control shows an indeterminate [RadProgressBar]({%slug getting_started%}#indeterminate-state). You can easily change this and indicate some loading progress. Read more in the [Progress Bar]({%slug radsplashscreen-features-progress-bar%}) article.

* __Customizable content/footer UI__: You can customize the content/footer of the splash screen by defining a template or by only setting the Content/Footer properties.

>tip Get started with the control with its [Getting Started]({%slug radsplashscreen-getting-started%}) help article that shows how to use it in a basic scenario.
