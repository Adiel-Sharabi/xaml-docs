# Improve Load Performance

In order to achieve optimal load performance with RadFileDialogs controls, you should be familiar with the following performance tips:

* Whenever possible, you should use a single instance of a dialog for multiple openings. This will reduce the opening time for every open after the initial one.

* Using the [No XAML]({%slug xaml-vs-noxaml%}#noxaml-assemblies) binaries along with [implicit styles]({%slug styling-apperance-implicit-styles-overview%}#setting-a-theme-using-implicit-styles) as a styling mechanism will improve the loading time of the dialogs compared to using the [StyleManager]({%slug styling-apperance-implicit-styles-overview%}#setting-a-theme-using-stylemanager).

* Setting the [ExpandToCurrentDirectory]({%slug radfiledialogs-features-common%}#disable-the-automatic-expanding-to-current-directory) to __False__ will improve the loading time.

* Setting an [InitialDirectory]({%slug radfiledialogs-features-common%}#setting-initial-directory) that has fewer directories and files will reduce the loading time.

* When developing an application that contains RadFileDialogs, run it in __Release__ mode, instead of in __Debug__ mode. This way you will avoid the caught exceptions while traversing the file system, which will improve performance.
