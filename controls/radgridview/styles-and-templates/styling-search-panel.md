# Styling Search Panel

>Before reading this topic, you might find it useful to get familiar with RadGridView's [Search As You Type]({%slug radgridview-search-as-you-type%}) functionality.

You can style the SearchPanel within the __RadGridView__ control by creating an appropriate Style that targets the __GridViewSearchPanel__ element.
 
You have two options:

* To create an empty style and set it up on your own.

* To copy the default style of the control and modify it.

>tip If you choose to define the style in the resources of the application, it would be available for the entire application. This allows you to define a style only once and then reuse it where needed.

You can apply a style to the Search Panel, similar to Example 1:

#### __[XAML] Example 1: Applying a style to the search panel of RadGridView:__
{{region gridview-styling-search-panel-0}}
	<Style TargetType="telerik:GridViewSearchPanel">
            <Setter Property="FontSize" Value="20"></Setter>
            <Setter Property="FontWeight" Value="Bold"></Setter>
            <Setter Property="Height" Value="50"></Setter>
	</Style>
{{endregion}}

#### __Figure 1: Appearance of the control after the style is applied:__

You can find the GridViewSearchPanel template structure in the [Templates Structure]({%slug radgridview-styles-and-templates-templates-structure%}) article for RadGridView.

## Change the color of the highlighted text 

By default, the symbols matching the searching criteria are colored in red. You can easily change the highlighted text value to green by changing the value of the __HightlightBrush__ in the __HighlightTextBlock__, as shown in Example 2:

#### __[XAML] Example 2: Change the HighlightBrush of the HighlightTextBlock.__
{{region gridview-styling-search-panel-0}}
	<Style TargetType="telerik:HighlightTextBlock">
			<Setter Property="HighlightBrush" Value="Green"/>		
	</Style> 
{{endregion}}

>If you're using [Implicit Styles]({%slug styling-apperance-implicit-styles-overview%}), you should base your style on the __HighlightTextBlockStyle__.
