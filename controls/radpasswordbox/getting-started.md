# Getting Started

This tutorial will walk you through the creation of a sample application that contains __RadPasswordBox__.

* [Assembly References](#assembly-references)
* [Adding RadPasswordBox to the Project](#adding-radpasswordbox-to-the-project)
* [Setting Watermark](#setting-watermark)

## Assembly References

In order to use the __RadPasswordBox__ control in your projects, you have to add references to the following assembly:			

* __Telerik.Windows.Controls__

## Adding RadPasswordBox to the Project

Before proceeding with adding __RadPasswordBox__ to your project, make sure the required assembly references are added to the project. 

You can add __RadPasswordBox__ manually by writing the XAML code in __Example 1__. You can also add the control by dragging it from the Visual Studio Toolbox and dropping it over the XAML view.

#### __[XAML] Example 1: Adding RadPasswordBox in XAML__

{{region passwordbox-getting-started_0}}
	<telerik:RadPasswordBox Width="150" />
{{endregion}}

>In order to use __RadPasswordBox__ in XAML you have to add the namespace declaration shown in __Example 2__:
>#### __[XAML] Example 2: Declaring Telerik Namespace__
>{{region telerik-schemas}}
>    xmlns:telerik="http://schemas.telerik.com/2008/xaml/presentation"
>{{endregion}}

If you run the application you will see the PasswordBox as illustrated in __Figure 1__. 

#### __Figure 1: RadPasswordBox generated by the code in Example 1__

## Setting Watermark

When RadPasswordBox is empty and not focused, Watermark content can be shown. __Example 2__ demonstrates how to set Watermark text.

#### __[XAML] Example 2: Setting a watermark__

{{region passwordbox-getting-started_1}}
	<telerik:RadPasswordBox Width="150" WatermarkContent="enter a password" />
{{endregion}}

__Figure 2__ shows the result.

## Working with RadPasswordBox

The Text property of the RadPasswordBox contains only the sequence of masking characters set by the PasswordChar property. The actual input can be reached through the Password and SecurePassword properties. These properties are not dependency properties (cannot be bound) due to security reasons. To get these properties in MVVM, you can pass the RadPasswordBox element to a command from your view model. Let's demonstrates this with some code.

First we will declare the RadPasswordBox in XAML and bind a RadButton control Command property to a command from your view model.

#### __[XAML] Example 3: Declare the RadPasswordBox in XAML__

{{region passwordbox-getting-started_2}}
	<StackPanel Orientation="Horizontal" VerticalAlignment="Center" HorizontalAlignment="Center" >
		<telerik:RadPasswordBox x:Name="passwordBox" WatermarkContent="enter a password" Width="150" Margin="0 0 10 0" />
		<telerik:RadButton Content="Log in" Command="{Binding LoadCommand}" CommandParameter="{Binding ElementName=passwordBox}"/>
	</StackPanel>
{{endregion}}

Now we just need to create our view model.

#### __[C#] Example 3: Create ViewModel__

{{region passwordbox-getting-started_2}}
	public  class ViewModel
	{
		public System.Windows.Input.ICommand LoadCommand { get; set; }
		public ViewModel()
		{
			LoadCommand = new DelegateCommand(OnLoadCommand_Executed);
		}

		private void OnLoadCommand_Executed(object obj)
		{
			var passwordBox = obj as RadPasswordBox;
			if(passwordBox != null)
			{
				// actual entered password
				var password = passwordBox.Password;
			}
		}
	}
{{endregion}}

Voil√†! Now when you click on the Login button, the __LoadCommand.Execute()__ method will be called. Inside the method you can get the __RadPasswordBox__ from the parameter and see the entered password from the __Password__ property.
