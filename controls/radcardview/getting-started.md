# Getting Started

This tutorial will walk you through the creation of a sample application that contains a __RadCardView__ control.

## Assembly References

To use RadCardView, add references to the following assemblies:

* __Telerik.Windows.Controls__
* __Telerik.Windows.Controls.Data__
* __Telerik.Windows.Data__

You can find the required assemblies for each control from the suite in the [Controls Dependencies]({%slug installation-installing-controls-dependencies-wpf%}) help article.

## Defining the RadCardView

To display data in the control, provide a collection of business objects and assign it to the __ItemsSource__ property of RadCardView. 

The following example shows how to setup a basic card model and populate the ItemsSource of the control.

#### __[C#] Example 1: Creating card model__
{{region radcardview-getting-started-0}}
	public class CardInfo
    {
        public string Header { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public int Number { get; set; }
    }
{{endregion}}

#### __[XAML] Example 2: Defining the control in XAML__
{{region radcardview-getting-started-1}}
	<telerik:RadCardView x:Name="cardView"  
						 CardHeaderBinding="{Binding Header}"
                         MinorLength="140"/>
{{endregion}}

#### __[C#] Example 3: Populating the control with data__
{{region radcardview-getting-started-2}}
	public MainWindow()
	{
            InitializeComponent();          
            var source = new ObservableCollection<CardInfo>();
            for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++)
            {
                source.Add(new CardInfo() { Header = "Card " + i, Name = "Name " + i, Number = i });
            }
            this.cardView.ItemsSource = source;
        }
    }
{{endregion}}

The example shows also how to tell what is the property displaying the card headers (via the __CardHeaderBinding__ property) and the height of the cards (via the __MinorLength__ property). The MinorLength will apply to the height or the width of the cards based on the [CardLayout]({%slug %}) property value.

## Manual Data Field Generation

By default the RadCardView cards will auto-generate [data fields]({%slug %}) for each public property of the card's model class. To interfere with this process, you can use the __AutoGeneratingDataFieldDescriptor__ event of the control, where the data field generation can be canceled or customized. Additionally, you can set the __AutoGenerateDataFieldDescriptor__ property to __False__ and define the data fields manually via the RadCardView's __DataFieldDescriptors__ collection.

## Data Manipulation

There are several mechanisms to customize the displayed data. You can filter, sort or group it. Additionally, when a card is selected, you can edit its data fields using the built-in UI. Read more about those features in the [Features]({%slug %}) section of the documentation.
