# Shapes

**Shapes** enable users to wrap text in a container and visualize it in a specific manner. 
There are different types of shapes determined by their visual appearance (shape, style, size, etc.). Their variation in shape and style makes them very useful for drawing attention to specific text. They could also be helpful to manipulate the text appearance (e.g. inline with text or with text wrapping) according to the rest of the document content.

>note Currently, RadRichTextBox supports the **import and export** of shapes from and to **Office Open XML (DOCX)**. When exporting to other formats the shapes will be lost.

## Working with Shapes 

RadRichTextBox enables you to insert, delete and edit shapes through its UI.

In the Insert tab, you will find a list containing various predefined shapes you can choose between. Once you insert a shape into the document, you can modify its settings and appearance so you can achieve the desired look of your document. Following is a list of the appearance settings you can modify for a shape:

- rotation
- position
- size
- fill
- borders
- adjust values (to customize the geometry of the shape)

> Shapes containing text are not supported in the current version.
