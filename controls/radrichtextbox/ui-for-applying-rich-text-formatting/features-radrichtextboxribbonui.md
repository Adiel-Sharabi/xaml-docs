# RadRichTextBoxRibbonUI



This topic explains how the predefined UI of __RadRichTextBox__ - __RadRichTextBoxRibbonUI__ - can be used.
      

__RadRichTextBoxRibbonUI__ is a ribbon control that has been wired to work with the commands that __RadRichTextBox__ exposes.
      

## Using RadRichTextBoxRibbonUI

RadRichTextBoxRibbonUI can be found in the Toolbox of Visual Studio, if you have installed the controls automatically.

>If you have not installed __Telerik UI__ automatically or the dlls you use are using are placed in another folder, you have to manually add the __RadRichTextBoxRibbonUI__ to the __Toolbox__. Here are the steps you have to follow in order to do this:
	1. Add references to the following DLLs in your project: <br/> __Telerik.Windows.Controls__<br/> __Telerik.Windows.Controls.Input__<br/>__Telerik.Windows.Controls.Navigation__ <br/> __Telerik.Windows.Controls.RibbonView__<br/> __Telerik.Windows.Controls.RichTextBoxUI__
	2. Drag __Telerik.Windows.Controls.RichTextBoxUI.dll__ to your toolbox. Ensure that __Telerik.Windows.Controls.RichTextBoxUI.VisualStudio.Design.dll__ assembly is in the same directory as __Telerik.Windows.Controls.RichTextBoxUI.dll__, so the Visual Studio can load it (actually it could be placed one level deeper in a subfolder named __Design__). 
>Now you should be able to drag the __RadRichTextBoxRibbonUI__ from the toolbox to the design surface.
          

In order to use it, you have to open the desired __UserControl__ and choose __Designer View__. Drag an instance of the __RadRichTextBoxRibbonUI__ in the designer area and drop it. Wait for a few seconds. After that all the XAML will be generated automatically and you will get a fully functional and fully customizable UI for your __RadRichTextBox__.
        

>The generated UI will automatically get attached to the first __RadRichTextBox__ control inside the __UserControl__.
          

If you take a closer look at the generated code there are a few things that must be mentioned:

1. The UI is represented by a __RadRibbonView__ control. You can freely add, remove or modify the elements in it.
            

1. To associate the UI with the __RadRichTextBox__, the latter one is passed as __DataContext__ of the __RadRichTextBoxRibbonUI__.
            

1. The functional elements (buttons, etc) have their __RadRichTextBoxRibbonUI__.__RichTextCommand__ property bound to a command exposed by the __RadRichTextBox__, which, as mentioned above, is set as __DataContext__ of the __RadRichTextBoxRibbonUI__.
            
>You can take a look at the XAML that is generated by following the steps in this topic in the [Telerik Editor](https://github.com/telerik/xaml-sdk/tree/master/RichTextBox/TelerikEditor) SDK example.

>tipTo learn more about the commands exposed by the __RadRichTextBox__ and how to use them read [here]({%slug radrichtextbox-features-commands%}).
          

By knowing that the UI is connected to the __RadRichTextBox__ via its __DataContext__, you can easily implement a scenario where you have more than one __RadRichTextBox__ controls ruled by one UI. You just have to change the __DataContext__ of the UI depending on which __RadRichTextBox__ is active.
