# Events

This article describes the __RadTileView__ and __RadTileViewItem__ events.

## RadTileView Events

The __RadTileView__ exposes the following events:
* __TileStateChanged__ - raised when the state of the item is changed.			

* __PreviewTileStateChanged__ - raised before the state of the item is changed. It is cancelable by setting the __Handled__ property of the event arguments to __True__.			

* __PreviewTileDragStarted__ - fired before a drag operation has started. It is cancelable by setting the __Handled__ property of the event arguments to __True__.			

* __TileDragStarted__ - fired after a drag operation has started.

* __TileDragEnded__ - fired after a drag operation has ended.

* __TilePositionChanged__ - fired when a tile's position has been changed while reordering the tiles with dragging.

* __PreviewTilePositionChanged__ - fired before the position of the item is changed. It is cancelable by setting the __Handled__ property of the event arguments to __True__.

* __PreviewTilesStateChanged__ - raised before the state of any items is changed. It is cancelable by setting the __Handled__ property of the event arguments to __True__.	

* __TilesStateChanged__ - raised after the state of all items is changed.

* __TilesPositionChanged__ - raised after the position of all items is changed and after all related animations have completed.

* __TilesAnimationCompleted__ - raised when the tiles animations have completed. The event handler receives two arguments:
	* The __sender__ argument contains the __RadTileView__ object triggering the tile animations.
	* A __TilesAnimationCompletedEventArgs__ object, which exposes an __AnimatedContainers__ property that gets the collection of the __RadTileViewItems__ that were animated.

The __RadTileViewItem__ exposes the following events:
* __PositionChanged__ - fired when a tile's position has been changed while reordering the tiles with dragging.

* __PreviewTileStateChanged -__ raised before the state of the item is changed. It is cancelable by setting the __Handled__ property of the event arguments to __True__.

* __TileStateChanged__ - raised when the state of the item is changed.
