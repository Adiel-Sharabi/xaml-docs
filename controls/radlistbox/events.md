# Events

The __RadListBox__ is an __ItemsControl__. Almost all of the exposed events are inherited from the __ItemsControl__ class. __RadListBox__ adds an additional event:

* __SelectionChanged__ - occurs when the selected item is changed. The __SelectionChanged__ event handler receives two arguments:      		

	* The sender argument contains the __RadListBox__. This argument is of type object, but can be cast to the __RadListBox__ type.

	* A __SelectionChangedEventArgs__ object which has the following properties:      			 

		1. AddedItems - gets a list that contains the items that were selected.

		1. RemovedItems - gets a list that contains the items that were unselected.
