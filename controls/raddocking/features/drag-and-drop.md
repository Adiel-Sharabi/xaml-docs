# Drag and Drop

The __Drag and Drop__ compatibilities of the __RadDocking__ control allow you to re-arange the panes in a complete __WYSIWYG__ manner. When the process of dragging starts, the [Compass]({%slug raddocking-features-compass%}) menu appears to help you dock/undock your panes. 

Below you can find several step-by-step tutorials for the most common operations that can be accomplished via drag and drop.
