## Key Features

* **Syntax highlighting**: Provides syntax highlighting for procedural programming and markup languages. Also allows users to customize built-in languages.

* **Find and replace**: Replace the specified text with the replacement text as per the conditions specified. Includes options to replace the first occurrence or all occurrences of the search text.
