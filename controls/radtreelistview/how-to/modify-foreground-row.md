# Modify foreground color of Selected/Hovered row

This help article explains how to modify the foreground color of __TreeListViewRow__ on selecting it or hovering over it.

Every row shows a set of __GridViewCells__. In order to change the foreground of all the __GridViewCells__ when their parent row is hovered/selected you should predefine the template of __TreeListViewRow__ and access the part __DataCellsPresenter__. This element is a plain presenter used to display the cells contained in a row.

You should then add an additional animation to the default hover/selection states of a row and manipulate the Foreground property of **PART_DataCellsPresenter**.
