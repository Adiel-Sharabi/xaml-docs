# WinForms Integration

WPF and Windows Forms present two different architectures for creating application interfaces. The **System.Windows.Forms.Integration** namespace provides classes that enable common interoperation scenarios.

The two key classes that implement interoperation capabilities are [WindowsFormsHost](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.integration.windowsformshost) and [ElementHost](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.integration.elementhost). This section demonstrates how the Telerik UI for {{ site.framework_name }} controls can be integrated in a WinForms application and vice versa.
