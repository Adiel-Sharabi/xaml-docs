# UI Test Automation with Appium  

Currently, Microsoft recommends using **Appium** with [WinAppDriver](https://github.com/Microsoft/WinAppDriver) as a UI testing tool for desktop and UWP applications.

**WinAppDriver** is a test framework developed by Microsoft as an open source project. It's an implementation of Appium which is primarily a Mobile App framework, itself based on Selenium. Therefore WinAppDriver is a Selenium-like automation framework combining the best of two worlds - encapsulating most of the technology of the now deprecated **CodedUI** and fusing it with the flexibility, easiness of use and adoption of **Selenium**.

This section in the documentation will walk you through the process of using **WinAppDriver** with the **Telerik UI for {{ site.framework_name }}** controls.
