## .NET Core Support Overview 

__Telerik UI for WPF__ comes with __.NET Core__ support. There is a set of dlls built against the .NET Core framework which you can reference in an application and start using the Telerik controls. See how to migrate your app in the [MigrÐ°ting to .NET Core]({%slug netcore-support-migration%}) article.

## Requirements

To work with the Telerik .NET Core dlls you will need to have the following installed.

* The latest [.NET Core 3.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0).

* The latest [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) 2019 version. You can also use Visual Studio 2017 Update 15.8 or higher with .Net Desktop Development workload and the following options checked: .NET Framework 4.7.2 and .NET Core 2.1 development tools. In this case you will need to manually [enable the .NET Core tooling](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-tooling-update-for-visual-studio-2017-version-15-9/).
