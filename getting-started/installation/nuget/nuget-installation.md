# Installing UI for WPF from NuGet Package

Telerik UI for WPF provides a set of nuget packages that can be used to easily install and upgrade Telerik projects.

This article describes how to set-up and use the nuget packages.

## Step 1: Adding NuGet Package Source 

The Telerik NuGet packages are available as downloadable `.nupkg` files that can be used in a local package source, and they also can be installed from the online Telerik NuGet server. The [Setting the NuGet Package Source]({%slug nuget-package-source-setup%}) article show how to setup local and online package sources.

This example shows how to install Telerik packages using the online server. This requires you to have an account in telerik.com and also a licensed (or trial) version of the product.

1. Navigate to the Package Manager Settings menu in Visual Studio.

1. Set the Telerik server as the current package source. This will prompt you to log into your telerik.com account. Enter user credentials and search for the needed package.
